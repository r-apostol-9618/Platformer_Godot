# Godot 4 - First 2D Game

This is a small 2D game project I created by following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0)

## 🎮 About

The game is a platformer demo with a tilemap world and simple player controls. It covers:

- Setting up a Godot 4 project
- Creating scenes and nodes
- Importing and using tilesets
- Player movement with GDScript


## 📱 Mobile (Android) Port

After finishing the tutorial, I also ported the game to Android using Godot’s export system. The controls were adapted for touch, and the game runs on mobile devices.
